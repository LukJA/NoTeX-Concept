# NoTeX-Concept

NoTeX - I [like] TeX, but I want something better... This repo is a temporary store while I develop the concept.

See https://lukja.github.io/NoTeX-Concept/ for more details about the concept...

**DISCLAIMER** - I genuinely have not got a clue what I am doing, take all content as opinion without merit...

### Notes

- To speed up diagram drawings, positions could be aliased, and the aliases used to create lines and sketches much faster, and allow for multiple lines to be modified by moving a single point reference.
