## Top Level Project Spec

With any project of a reasonable scale, its worth stepping back and taking as high-level a look at what you wish to achieve as possible, before diving into subtle implementational challenges (as tempting as it is to just get going). Hopefully, this will prevent wasted work and reduce the chance of missing the goals the project sets out to achieve, and thus:

### **L1 Goal** - 11/12/2020

>To develop a workflow to create professional feeling documents, reports et al. with the **speed, simplicity and availability of MarkDown**, and the **power, elegance and aesthetic of LaTeX**, with a focus on meeting the needs of Undergraduate STEM students.

### **L2 - Unpicking the Above**

#### The **speed, simplicity and availability of MarkDown** ~

MarkDown (.md) is generally pretty great for a few reasons:

- Implementing common formatting used in notes is quick and simple, but its focus is on readability and it is directed towards writing for **the web**, infact this entire docs site is written in MarkDown!.

- Its very well supported across numerous environments, with great options available for its development and extensions for tools such as VSCode commonplace.

- Instant Previews and WYSIWYG are very common, leading to a very quick and debug/error free development cycle.

All the basic commands used in a .md file can be summarised as follows:

    ## <- H1
    ### <- H3 (etc.)

    **Bold**
    *Italic*

    * Unordered
    * List

    1. Ordered 
    2. List

    > Quote
    >> Nested quote

... Which directly translates to ...

## <- H1

### <- H3 (etc.)

**Bold**
*Italic*

- Ordered
- List

1. Ordered
2. List

> Quote
>> Nested quote

Hence the **speed** of creation of MarkDown documents, the **simplicity** of their construction, and the **availability** of the development tools that can be used to generate and preview documents are all highly admirable features to target.

For the use-case I am looking to meet however, .md has some issues.

- **Web Focused:** By design .md lacks any concept of pagination, and hence producing documents intended to be A4 and the likes would require an external tool (that no doubt exists). However, as a result document style formatting facilities are heavily limited (header/footer, margins and the likes).
- **Insufficient Power:** .md in its purity lacks the ability to do complex operations such as custom tables, positional control, diagrams and graphics beyond static images, as well as basic things in many cases such as adjusting the appearance of headings and text, and text colours.

In essence .md is not designed for the sort of document generation we are looking for, but we could do worse than to borrow some of its syntax fundamentals.

#### The **power, elegance and aesthetic of LaTeX**

LaTeX, as discussed in [Part 1](https://lukja.github.io/NoTeX-Concept/2020/11/28/NoTeX-TheConcept.html), is like a finely crafted sabre, except there is no handle, you just have to hold the sharp part of the blade and cry in pain. Of course if you can bear it for an extended period of time, it will of course make fine work of the task at hand.

- Latex has packages that let you do *almost* anything you can imagine (if you can figure out how to get them, and then how to use them..). Everything from as simple as a bold letter function in maths, to inline tikz graphics and function plotting is possible, although it takes a finer hand than mine to harness their power.

- LaTeX is elegant, its replicates the common software paradigm of a set of source files being built into a single output executable or in this case, a .pdf file. As such the created document is "immutable" and can be distributed as a separate entity from the source. Pdf files are an excellent choice these days, the spec is public domain and their ubiquity makes them a defacto document standard, and for our use case Pdf generation is essentially a requirement.

- The aesthetic and readability of documents created with LaTeX is unquestionable, and the undergraduate lecture notes we are given that are LaTeX based are immediately recognizable and substantially more enjoyable to read compared to what I assume are Word or similar based documents.

However, LaTeX is far more feature-full and allows for far more customization than I have ever required, and does so at the cost of speed and simplicity. The majority of the time I have spent with LaTeX has been fiddling with the finer details of positioning, formatting and debugging, far more than actually writing the document itself I expect.

My hope is to find a happy "medium" between LaTeX and .md, that optimizes the effort-reward ratio.

### **L3 - Developping an Alpha spec**

To be concluded, I am yet to decide upon a firm spec - some development research is necessary into capabilities.
