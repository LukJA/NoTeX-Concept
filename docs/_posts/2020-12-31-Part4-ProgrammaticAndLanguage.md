## Programmatic Thoughts (DOM and language architecture)

### Language Architecture

#### Document Model



#### Editor Input

**We** can be certain that a function character will be required to identify keywords from prose, for which LaTeX proposed the backslash `\`.

I propose either the pipe `|`, the *whatever this is* `Â¬`, the fullstop `.` or the backquote itself ~`~.

The first two are optimal as arguable the least frequently used glyphs on a keyboard, but both require pressing the shift key, which is slow.

Alternatively the fullstop and backtick both are immediately available, but more frequently needed in general prose.
